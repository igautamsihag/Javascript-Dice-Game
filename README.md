# Dice Game

This repository contains the code for a simple Dice Game built using JavaScript. The game simulates the roll of one or more dice, generating random numbers each time a player "rolls" the dice. The goal is to provide an interactive, fun, and educational project to demonstrate how to use random number generation, DOM manipulation, and basic JavaScript logic.
